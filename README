README Document for the webcam interactive interferometer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Created: 26.2.14
Updated: 26.2.14

Required Equipment:
-extrenal USB webcam
-coins or small round objects
-flat, light colored area (A3 or A2 paper)

Software:
python script: gen_psf_interferometer_detect_skyim.py
test sky image: such as astro_test_image.jpg

The code is in the directory: /home/griffin/Downloads/interactiveInterferometer

To Run:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. before plugging in the webcam, run:

    ls /dev/video*

2. plug in the webcam and again run:

    ls /dev/video*

A new video device should appear, remember the ID number as this will be used in the script. For this example the external webcam is /dev/video1, so it has ID:1

3. run the script: gen_psf_interferometer_detect_skyim.py

For script help run: python gen_psf_interferometer_detect_skyim.py -h

To run the script with the webcam ID and test sky image: python gen_psf_interferometer_detect_skyim.py -c 1 -i /home/griffin/Downloads/interactiveInterferometer/astro_test_image.jpg


Changing Settings:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A few parameters can be altered.

A Gaussian funstion is applied to the PSF, this can be disabled by commenting out the line:

    psf=psf*gaussGrid

To change the size of the Gaussian function change the last two number in the line (they are in pixels):

    gaussFunc=gauss2d(0.,0.,1.,30.,30.)

The circles are detected using the cv2.HoughCircles() function, it takes a number of parameters which are documented in the code and on the opencv webpage.
